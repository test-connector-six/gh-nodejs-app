# Security Considerations

This document outlines the security considerations for the gh-nodejs-app application.

## Recent Security Fixes

The following critical security vulnerabilities have been addressed:

### 1. CVE-2023-26136 (CVSS Score: 9.8)
- **Component**: tough-cookie
- **Description**: Prototype Pollution vulnerability in the CookieJar component

### 2. CVE-2024-5535 (CVSS Score: 9.1)
- **Component**: OpenSSL (libssl3, libcrypto3)
- **Description**: Buffer overread vulnerability in the SSL_select_next_proto function
- **Fix**: Updated base image to Node.js 20 on Alpine 3.19 and explicitly upgraded OpenSSL packages

## Additional Security Improvements

1. **Reduced Privileges**: 
   - Container now runs as a non-root user (node)
   - Added proper init process with tini

2. **Updated Dependencies**:
   - Using a more recent Node.js version with security patches
   - Explicitly defined all dependencies with fixed versions

## Security Best Practices

1. **Avoid running containers in privileged mode**
2. **Regularly update dependencies**
3. **Scan images for vulnerabilities before deployment**
4. **Use the principle of least privilege**
5. **Implement proper secret management**
